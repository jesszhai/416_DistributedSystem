This is the starting point for A4. If you do a 
make it will build the bully program. 
You can do a quick demo by doing make demo

You should probably try a bunch of different runs 
to get a sense of what is happening. Here are a few
more to try. 

/home/c/cs416/fgmpi/bin/mpirun -nfg 4 -n 4 ./bully
/home/c/cs416/fgmpi/bin/mpirun -nfg 12 -n 8 ./bully
/home/c/cs416/fgmpi/bin/mpirun -nfg 4 -n 1 ./bully
/home/c/cs416/fgmpi/bin/mpirun -nfg 1 -n 4 ./bully
